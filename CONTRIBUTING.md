## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/rust-learning-journey.git
    cd rust-learning-journey
    ```

3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that indicates the purpose of your branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix-typo-in-readme  # Example: Fixing a typo in the README
    git checkout -b add-new-exercise     # Example: Adding a new exercise
    git checkout -b implement-feature-x # Example: If you were to implement some new feature, although this isn't a project that's currently doing this.
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code, documentation, or other files. Be sure to follow the coding conventions and style guidelines used in the repository.

5.  **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues. For code changes, run the appropriate tests (if any).
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Fix: Correct typo in README.md"  # Example
    ```

    *   Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update").
    *   Keep the first line short (under 50 characters).
    *   Provide a more detailed explanation in the body of the commit message (if necessary).

7.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin fix-typo-in-readme  # Replace with your branch name
    ```

8.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "Create Pull Request" button.

    *   Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
    *   In the description, explain the purpose of your changes and any relevant background information.
    *   Link to any relevant issues or discussions.

9.  **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions.

10. **Merging:** Once your pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Code Style Guidelines

*   Follow the standard Rust coding conventions (as enforced by `rustfmt`).
*   Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
*   Write comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.
*   Keep code concise and readable.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   Write clear and concise explanations.
*   Use proper grammar and spelling.
*   Provide code examples to illustrate concepts.
*   Link to relevant external resources.

## Creating Exercises

*   Provide clear instructions for the exercise.
*   Include a solution (in a separate file or directory) for learners to compare their work against.
*   Test the exercise to ensure it is solvable and the solution is correct.
