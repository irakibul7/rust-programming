# Hello World Program

The main function is the entry point of the program. It is the first function that is called when the program is run.


The line `fn main() {` declares a function named main that takes no arguments and returns nothing.

The line `} `closes the main function.

The line `println!` is a macro that prints a string to the console.

The line `let name = "Rustacean";` declares a variable named name and assigns it the value "Rustacean". This line ends with a semicolon(;) which is used to indicate the end of a statement.

The line `print!("Hello, {}!", name);` prints the string "Hello, Rustacean!" to the console.

## What is a macro?

A macro is an expression that has a `!` before the parenthesis (). i.e.
macro_name!()

## What are macros used for?

Macros are used to generate code at compile time. They are used to create functions, structs, enums, and other code constructs.

# The Basic Formatting Rules

- Rust code blocks are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- Statements are terminated by a semicolon `;`.
- Expressions do not end with a semicolon.
- Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword.
- Variables are declared using the `let` keyword.
- Comments are enclosed in `//`.

## Single Placeholder

The single placeholder is used to format a single value in a string.

```rust
let name = "Rustacean";
println!("Hello, {}!", name);
```

## Multiple Placeholders

The multiple placeholders are used to format multiple values in a string.

```rust
let name = "Rustacean";
let age = 25;
println!("Hello, {}! You are {} years old.", name, age); // Hello, Rustacean! You are 25 years old.
```

## Positional Arguments

The positional arguments specify the position of the value in the string.

The first value is assigned 0, the second value is assigned 1, and so on.

```rust
let name = "Rustacean";
let age = 25;
println!("{1} is {0} years old.", age, name); // Rustacean is 25 years old.
```

## Named Arguments

The named arguments specify the name of the value in the string.

```rust
let name = "Rustacean";
let age = 25;
println!("{name} is {age} years old."); // Rustacean is 25 years old.
```

## Placeholder Traits

If we want to convert the value to binary, hexadecimal, or octal write:

`{:b}` for binary
`{:x}` for hexadecimal
`{:o}` for octal

```rust
let num = 10;
println!("Binary: {:b}, Hexadecimal: {:x}, Octal: {:o}", num, num, num); // Binary: 1010, Hexadecimal: a, Octal: 12
```

## Debug Trait

It is possible to print multiple values using a single placeholder with the debug trait.

```rust
let name = "Rustacean";
let age = 25;
println!("{:?}", (name, age)); // ("Rustacean", 25)
``` 

# Printing Styles

The table below shows the different macros used to print in Rust.

| Macro | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `println!` | Prints a string to the console. |
| `print!` | Prints a string to the console without a newline. |
| `eprintln!` | Prints an error message to the console with a newline. |
| `eprint!` | Prints an error message to the console without a newline. |


# Comments

Comments are used to add notes to the code. They are not compiled and are ignored by the compiler.

## Line Comments

Line comments are used to add comments to a single line of code.

```rust
let x = 5; // This is a line comment.
```

## Block Comments

Block comments are used to add comments to multiple lines of code.

```rust
/* This is a block comment.
This is a block comment.
This is a block comment.
*/
```

## Doc Comments

Doc comments are used to add documentation to the code. They are used to describe the code and are used by the compiler to generate documentation.

```rust
/// This is a doc comment.
```

# Variables

Variables are used to store values. By default, variables are immutable.

## Binding

Rust uses the `let` keyword to bind a value to a variable.

## Naming Conventions

- Variable names must start with a lowercase letter.
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.

## Initialize a Variable

The example below declares a variable named `language` and binds it to the value `"Rust"`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let language = "Rust";
    println!("{}", language); // Rust
}
```

## Make a Variable Mutable

To make a variable mutable, we use the `mut` keyword.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut language = "Rust";
    language = "Python";
    println!("{}", language); // Python
}
```

## Assigning Multiple Variables

It is possible to assign multiple variables in a single statement.

```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2);
println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y); // x: 1, y: 2
```

# Scope and Shadowing

Scope is the region of the code where a variable is valid. Shadowing is a feature that allows a variable to be reassigned a new value.

## Scope

The scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where a program can access the variable.

There are two types of variables:

- Local variables:

A variable that is within a block of code, `{}` that cannot be accessed outside of the block is a local variable.
After the closing brace `}` of the block, the variable is freed and memory for the variable is deallocated.

- Global variables:

A variable that is declared outside of a block of code is a global variable.
Global variables are valid for the entire program and are not freed until the program terminates.

```rust
fn main() {
    let outer_var = "Outer Variable";
    {
        let inner_var = "Inner Variable";
        println!("{}", inner_var);
        println!("{}", outer_var);
    }
    println!("{}", inner_var); // use of inner_var outside of the block
}
```

```error
error[E0425]: cannot find value `inner_var` in this scope
 --> main.rs:8:36
  |
8 |     println!("inner variable: {}", inner_var); // use of inner_var outside scope
  |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: a local variable with a similar name exists: `outer_variable`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0425`.
```

## Shadowing

Shadowing is a technique that allows a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This is also known as masking.

```rust
fn main() {
    let outer = 12;
    {
        let inner = 13;
        let outer = 14;
        println!("{}", outer); // 14
    }
    println!("{}", outer); // 12
}
```

# Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.

We can define a variable in two ways in Rust:

## Implicit Type

The compiler infers the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it.

```rust
let x = 5; // x is of type i32
```

## Explicit Type

The programmer specifies the type of the variable.

```rust
let x: i32 = 5; // x is of type i32
```

# Primitive Data Types

The following tree shows the different primitive data types in Rust.

                        Primitive Data Types
                               |

                 |                          |
              Scalar                    Compound
                 |                          |
        +--------+--------+          +------+------+
        |               |           |             |

        |               |
   +----+----+    +-----+-------+
   |         |    |             |
Integer   Float  Boolean    Character

# Scalar Type

They store a single value.

Below is the list of scalar types:

## Integer
- Example: 54, -98
- Stores whole numbers
- Can be signed (i8, i16, i32, i64, i128) or unsigned (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128)
- Default is i32

## Float
- Example: 54.6, -98.8
- Stores decimal numbers
- Types: f32 (single precision) and f64 (double precision)
- Default is f64

## Boolean
- Example: true, false
- Stores true or false values
- One byte in size

## Character (char)
- Example: 'a', 'A', 'üòÄ'
- Stores a single Unicode character
- Uses single quotes
- Four bytes in size

# Compound Type

They group multiple values into one variable. Below is the list of compound types:

## Array
- Example: [1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, 4Ô∏è‚É£, 5Ô∏è‚É£, 6Ô∏è‚É£]
- Fixed length collection of same type elements
- Type notation: [T; N] where T is type and N is length
- Zero-based indexing

## Tuple
- Example: ("Hi", 2, 'a', 6, 5, 6)
- Fixed length collection of different type elements
- Type notation: (T1, T2, ...) where T1, T2 are types
- Zero-based indexing
